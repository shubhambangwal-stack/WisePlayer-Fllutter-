TODO: lib\presentation\screen_view\common\auth\fetch_phone_info_mac.dart
Refactor the API calls in checkUserStatus() to run in parallel and handle errors more gracefully.
Extract device registration logic from getDeviceInfo0() into a separate service class for better testability.
Add proper loading state management instead of using a fixed 1-second delay in the refresh button.
Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for failed API requests.
Securely store the device key and token using encrypted storage instead of plain shared preferences.
Add null-safety and type validation for all API response fields before saving to SharedPref.
Replace hardcoded QR image URL with a dynamic value returned from the backend.
Disable or hide action buttons while API requests are in progress to prevent duplicate calls.
Add unit tests and widget tests for device status flow and activation UI states.
Improve user feedback by showing success/error snackbars after refresh and activation attempts.


TODo: lib\data\_api\api_services\api_services.dart
Centralize base URL handling to avoid mixing relative paths and $baseUrl$endpoint patterns.
Add request and response interceptors for logging, token injection, and common error handling.



Create a unified error parser to convert Dio errors into consistent user-friendly messages.
Extract status code checks into a reusable helper to remove duplicated 200/201 logic.
Implement timeout and retry policies for network resilience.
Add generic typing to hitPostApi so it can return strongly typed response models.
Move hardcoded endpoint strings to the Endpoints constants for consistency.
Support optional headers (device token and fingerprint) in validateStatus via parameters.
Add unit tests with mocked Dio client to verify success and failure scenarios.
Introduce a base API method wrapper to standardize all POST requests and reduce boilerplate.
